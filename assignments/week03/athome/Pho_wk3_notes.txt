Week 3 Mashup (CL Apt+ Yelp Food)
-Pho Diep (1/27/2013) phodiep@gmail.com

The of script pulls Craigslist ads for apartments/houses available in the seattle area.
It then extracts only the posts with specific location info available (longitude, latitude).
Using those Long/Lat coordinates, the script then pulls up the 2 best matches (via Yelp) for each of the following (near the home that's available for rent)… Bars, pizza, sushi
more can be added easily

It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the craiglist ads and the Yelp API for business info.
(the CL ads are for the current day only… still a very long list, may want to ctr+c to exit once satisfied :)
all of this is printed out in the terminal, so not very user friendly, but it displays the script is working.

**You'll need to install BeautifulSoup4 and oauth2 in VirtualEnv. This is all the soupenv we created in class.

to run: 
python Pho_wk3.py


PS. I'm also currently working on a html version that will hopefully be executable in a browser. May have that running by tuesday. But it's a very long CL list, so I either have to speed it up some how or limit the number of CL listings.
I'm having the Web_version of the script write out the html, so it can then be read by the browser, not sure if it's faster to write to file and then open/load into script again, or keep the html as a very long string and have the browser read it directly from script. (probably the later)
now i'm just rambling… Have fun!
